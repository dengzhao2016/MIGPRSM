For convenience, we abbreviate MIGPRSM (Algorithm 1) with j = 2; 3; 4 as MIGPR2, MIGPR3 and MIGPR4 respectively.

In case you use the results of this paper, we suggest you cite:
Z. Deng, J.C. Bai, and D.R. Han, "Multi-step Inertial Generalized Proximal Peaceman-Rachford Splitting Method for Separable Convex Programming", 

Notification:
we use the widely-used MATLAB ADMM package downloaded
at http://web.stanford.edu/Ëœboyd/papers/admm/, with the only slight
revision for our proposed MIGPRSM.
